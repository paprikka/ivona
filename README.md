# Ivona

## The Simplest Possible Wrapper Around Ivona REST API

### 0. Why? 

Because the API provided by [Ivona](http://www.ivona.com/en/) is huuuge and in most cases only small pat of it is utilized. Also, [node-ivona](https://github.com/pilwon/node-ivona) makes creating apps like these extremely simple.

What I wanted to get is a simple service returning urls to audio files with answers generated by [Sulik](https://github.com/paprikka/sulik).

### 1. Basic usage:

1. go to `https://myapp.dev/tts/<uri encoded text goes here>`
2. response will be a 302 redirect to MP3 file with generated speech.

### 2. Installation

1. Use ES6 Harmony compatible version of NodeJS
2. Set up SSL certificates (find out how to create a self-signed certificate [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self))

```
    IVONA_API_KEY=" ... "
    IVONA_LOGIN_EMAIL=" ... "
    SSL_KEY=" ... "
    SSL_CERT=" ... "

    # optional
    PORT=3003

```
3. npm install 
4. npm start

### 3. To do

[ ] Add JSON POST API w. **very** simple configuration settings (voice, returned format)
